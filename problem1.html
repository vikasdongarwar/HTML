        <h1>b tag</h1>
        <p>
            The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's
            contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was
            formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the 
            text in boldface.
        </p>
        <h1>i tag</h1>
        <p>
            The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i naming of this element.
        </p>
        <h1>u tag</h1>
        <p>
            The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.
        </p>
        <h1>select tag</h1>
        <p>
            The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.     
        </p>
        <h1>button tag</h1>
        <p>
            The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
